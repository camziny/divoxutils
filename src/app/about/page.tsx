            Inspired by the legacy of daocutils and venerable predecessors like
            gimpchimp, divoxutils is crafted to honor their influence and to
            continue their mission.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            When daocutils was no longer available, it left a noticeable gap for
            many avid Dark Age of Camelot enthusiasts who needed a way to keep
            track of their characters. That&apos;s where the idea for divoxutils
            came in. I set out to create a new hub where players can easily
            manage their character&apos;s progress and celebrate their triumphs
            (rr12+ dings). Divoxutils is all about enhancing your gameplay by
            keeping you connected to your characters&apos; journeys in a
            user-friendly and engaging way.

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
